we are a graphic design studio based in bangalore, india.  we love collaborations,<br />
change and lightness.<br /><br />

we specialise in print and illustration - branding and identity, posters, books<br />
and publications, packaging, information graphics, murals, invitations, t-shirts... <br /> 
we also enjoy working with spaces, both physical spaces and the web,<br />
adapting our design process to different requirements and across media,<br />
bringing passion, commitment and honesty to everything we do.<br /><br />

a husband-wife team, we are both graduates of the <a href="http://www.srishti.ac.in" target="_blank" class="link"><u>srishti</u></a> school of art, design<br />
and technology, bangalore. &nbsp;roy also has a bachelorâ€™s degree in management.   <br />
both of us initially worked at design firms - roy at tsk design, bangalore,<br />
and arati at 99&1 design, chennai. &nbsp;we moved to sri lanka and gained<br />
experience in advertising during a 3-year stint. &nbsp;roy was creative director for<br />
ogilvy; arati was art director for masters ddb and later worked as a consultant<br />
to advertising agencies.<br /><br />

we returned to bangalore to set up our own studio in 2007, combining our<br />
experiences and strengths. &nbsp;roy illustrates and takes photographs and arati learns<br />
indian classical music and dance. &nbsp;we like to seek and experience the simplicity<br />
of life as it fuels our ability to create. &nbsp;we find peace in doing meaningful work<br />
and love collaborations that create change.<br /><br />
